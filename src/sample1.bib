ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a study on the data measurements that the Hokuyo UST-20LX Laser Rangefinder produces, which compiles into an overall characterization of the LiDAR sensor relative to indoor environments. The range measurements, beam divergence, angular resolution, error effect due to some common painted and wooden surfaces, and the error due to target surface orientation are analyzed. It was shown that using a statistical average of sensor measurements provides a more accurate range measurement. It was also shown that the major source of errors for the Hokuyo UST-20LX sensor was caused by something that will be referred to as &ldquo;mixed pixels&rdquo;. Additional error sources are target surface material, and the range relative to the sensor. The purpose of this paper was twofold: (1) to describe a series of tests that can be performed to characterize various aspects of a LIDAR system from a user perspective, and (2) present a detailed characterization of the commonly-used Hokuyo UST-20LX LIDAR sensor.},
