ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a study on the data measurements that the Hokuyo UST-20LX Laser Rangefinder produces, which compiles into an overall characterization of the LiDAR sensor relative to indoor environments. The range measurements, beam divergence, angular resolution, error effect due to some common painted and wooden surfaces, and the error due to target surface orientation are analyzed. It was shown that using a statistical average of sensor measurements provides a more accurate range measurement. It was also shown that the major source of errors for the Hokuyo UST-20LX sensor was caused by something that will be referred to as &ldquo;mixed pixels&rdquo;. Additional error sources are target surface material, and the range relative to the sensor. The purpose of this paper was twofold: (1) to describe a series of tests that can be performed to characterize various aspects of a LIDAR system from a user perspective, and (2) present a detailed characterization of the commonly-used Hokuyo UST-20LX LIDAR sensor.},

abstract = {In this theoretical study, modulation techniques are developed to support the Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) mission. A continuous wave (CW) lidar system using sine waves modulated by maximum length (ML) pseudo-noise (PN) codes is described for making simultaneous online/offline differential absorption measurements. Amplitude and phase-shift keying (PSK) modulated intensity modulation (IM) carriers, in addition to a hybrid-pulse technique are investigated, which exhibit optimal autocorrelation properties. A method is presented to bandwidth limit the ML sequence based on a filter implemented in terms of Jacobi theta functions, which does not significantly degrade the resolution or introduce sidelobes as a means of reducing aliasing and IM carrier bandwidth.},

The goal is to provide researchers in the fields of obstacle detection, range data segmentation, obstacle tracking or surface reconstruction with a versatile and powerful software package that is easy to use and allows to focus on algorithmic improvements rather than on building the software framework around it. The simulation environment and the actual simulations can be efficiently distributed with a single compact file. Our proposed approach facilitates easy regeneration of published results, hereby highlighting the value of reproducible research.",

In this paper, the approximation is removed and the method extended to conics and general surfaces of revolution.},

abstract="Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a tool that systematically implements the chain rule of differentiation to obtain the derivatives of functions calculated by computer programs. In this paper, it is assessed as a tool for engineering design. The paper discusses the forward and reverse modes of AD, their computing requirements, as well as approaches to implementing AD. It continues with the application of two different tools to two medium-size structural analysis problems to generate sensitivity information typically necessary in an optimization or design situation. The paper concludes with the observation that AD is to be preferred to finite differencing in most cases, as long as sufficient computer storage is available; in some instances, AD may be the alternative to consider in lieu of analytical sensitivity analysis.",
